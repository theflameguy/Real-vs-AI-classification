# Real-vs-AI Classification

This project focuses on classifying real art images versus AI-generated art images using deep learning techniques. By analyzing patterns and features in the images, the model distinguishes between artworks created by humans and those generated by artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

With the increasing prevalence of AI-generated art, distinguishing real art from AI-generated counterparts has become a significant challenge. This project aims to:

- Build a robust classification model.
- Analyze key features that differentiate real and AI-generated images.
- Provide an open-source solution for research and educational purposes.

---

## Features

- **Custom Dataset Handling**: Implements a dataset loader for organizing and preprocessing images.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pretrained models such as ResNet
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes transformations like resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays model predictions and insights.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theflameguy/Real-vs-AI-classification.git
   cd Real-vs-AI-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:


Alternatively, install directly from the notebook:
   ```bash
   %pip install torch torchvision torchsummary numpy matplotlib timm torchmetrics opencv-python
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashbowman/ai-generated-images-vs-real-images).
   - Place dataset in the `archive` folder.

2. **Train the model**:
3. **Evaluate the model**:
4. **Run predictions on new images**:

## Dataset

The dataset is organized into folders with subdirectories for each class:

- **Real art images**: Sourced from verified human-created artwork databases.
- **AI-generated art images**: Sourced from platforms like DALL-E, MidJourney, or Stable Diffusion.

Ensure the dataset structure follows this format:
```
archive/
  |-- RealArt/
  |     |-- image1.jpg
  |     |-- image2.jpg
  |-- AiArtData/
        |-- image1.jpg
        |-- image2.jpg
```

---

## Model

The project uses transfer learning with architectures like:

- RexNet-150

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (adjustable)
- **Data Augmentation**: Resize, normalization, and tensor conversion.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 90:5:5.

## Results

| Metric         | Value       |
|----------------|-------------|
| Accuracy       | 82.5%       |
| F1-Score       | 89.0%       |
